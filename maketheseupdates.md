# Timeline Updates Instructions

This document outlines the files that need to be updated to enhance the LLM Context Window Timeline project.

## Files to Update

1. Add the resources section to the main index.html file:
   ```
   /Users/willf/smartIndex/longcontexttimeline/index.html
   ```
   Follow the instructions in:
   ```
   /Users/willf/smartIndex/longcontexttimeline/addResourcesProtocols.md
   ```

2. Add the research findings about recent LLM context window capabilities:
   ```
   /Users/willf/smartIndex/longcontexttimeline/addTheseResearch.md
   ```
   This information should be incorporated into your timeline data or as a new reference section, depending on your preference.

## Implementation Steps

1. For the resources section:
   - Add the CSS code from addResourcesProtocols.md to your existing style section
   - Insert the HTML markup for the resources section just before the closing `</div>` tag of your container

2. For the research findings:
   - Consider adding new timeline entries for key architectural innovations like Scalable-Softmax
   - Update existing timeline entries with the latest benchmark information for Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, DeepSeek R1, etc.
   - Create references to the linked academic papers and resources

## Post-Update Verification

After making these changes, ensure that:
- The site's responsive design still works properly
- Dark/light theme toggle functions correctly with the new sections
- All links in the resources section are functional
- The timeline display remains visually cohesive

These updates will significantly enhance both the informational value and utility of your LLM Context Window Timeline project.
